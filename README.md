Pringles is a DEVS model composition library, which makes easy to assemble and link multiple atomic/coupled models. It works as a Python library, and in its road ahead, will easily integrate with the Jupyter environment.


#### Requirements
- Python 3.7

The library can be installed with pip:
```
pip install pringles-devs
```

#### Extra Requirements
For local development, you can install everything through:
```
make install
```
is the repo root directory.

After changes are made you can locally check the same things the CI does by executing:
```
make local
```
